# News Aggregator

## Description
This is a simple webpage that pulls news headlines based off a search term that is entered into the search bar. The user is given a summary of the story, and can click on the story in order to read the whole thing.

Potential Expansions:
- Fix the Search bar to make it centered
- Update the colour scheme to be easier on the eyes
- Add a back end to send the API requests through
